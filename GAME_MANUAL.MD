## 🎮 Game Basics (5 Minute Read)

### What Am I Doing?
You're building a "lazy empire" to climb the **Lazy Score** leaderboards through:
- **Recruiting units** that make you money
- **Attacking other players** to steal their stuff  
- **Joining alliances** for protection and bonuses
- **Upgrading facilities** for better production

### Core Resources
- **💰 Credits** - Main currency for everything
- **👥 OnlyFans Models** - Generate 10 credits/hour each (passive income)
- **🔫 Minions** - Defend you and help with activities
- **🌿 Weed** - Keeps everyone happy and enables special attacks
- **🔄 Turns** - Spend these to do actions (get 2 every 10 minutes, max 200)

### The Golden Rule: **Keep Happiness Above 70%**
- Unhappy units produce less and may **desert forever**
- Models need fair payouts and minion protection
- Minions need weapons and Moutai drinks

## ⚡ Quick Success Tips

### First 30 Minutes Checklist
1. **Scout** 2-3 times to get models and minions
2. **Grow** once to start weed production  
3. **Shop** for basic weapons (Sig P365) and Moutai
4. Check **Dashboard** happiness - fix if below 60%
5. Find weak targets in **Attack** menu for easy raids

### Daily Routine
- Log in every few hours to spend turns (don't waste them!)
- Check happiness and fix problems immediately
- Scout for new units to grow your empire
- Attack vulnerable players when they're offline
- Coordinate with empire members for big raids

### Critical Mistakes to Avoid
- ❌ Letting happiness drop below 50%
- ❌ Hoarding turns (you stop earning at 200)
- ❌ Attacking much stronger players
- ❌ Playing solo (join an empire ASAP)
- ❌ Forgetting to buy weapons for minions

## 🎯 Combat Quick Reference

### Target Selection
- **Green Indicators** = Easy targets (similar/weaker power)
- **Red Indicators** = Dangerous targets (much stronger)
- Check their recent activity (offline players are easier)

### Attack Types
- **Drive-By** 💨 = Quick, safe credit raids
- **Home Invasion** 🏠 = Higher risk/reward, can destroy buildings
- **Jack Cybertrucks** 🚗 = Steal their vehicles
- **Smokeup Models** 🌿 = Reduce their income with diseases
- **Steal Models** 👥 = Take their income units directly

### Success Factors
- **Your Power** vs **Their Defense**
- **Weapon Quality** (better weapons = higher success)
- **Empire Bonuses** (alliance minions help everyone)
- **Element of Surprise** (attack when they're offline)
